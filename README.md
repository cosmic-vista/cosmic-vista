## About me

I am a final-year B.Tech (CSE) student specializing in backend development using the **MERN stack**. I design and implement robust APIs, integrate full-stack features, and containerize applications with **Docker** for reproducible deployments. To keep my algorithmic skills sharp, I regularly practice **DSA in C++** and focus on writing readable, well-tested code. My approach is practical: ship working solutions quickly, then iterate and improve based on real feedback.

## Quick highlights

- âœ… Backend-focused: REST APIs, authentication, database modelling  
- âœ… MERN: React (frontend) + Node.js & Express (backend) + MongoDB  
- âœ… Deployment: Dockerized apps and basic CI workflows  
- âœ… Competitive programming: C++ (DSA) for placement readiness
